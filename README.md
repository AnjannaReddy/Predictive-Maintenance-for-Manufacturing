# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Manufacturing
Project Overview

Predictive Maintenance aims to predict equipment failures before they occur to reduce unplanned downtime and maintenance costs in manufacturing systems.
This project uses sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure, etc.) collected from multiple machines over time to analyze machine health and predict the likelihood of failure within a given time window.

The system enables proactive maintenance decisions â€” allowing factories to replace or repair parts before breakdowns occur, leading to increased productivity and operational efficiency.
